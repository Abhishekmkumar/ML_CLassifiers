# ML_CLassifiers

#### Machine learning classifiers are algorithms or models in machine learning designed to categorize data points into predefined classes or categories based on their features. These models learn from labeled training data and use the learned patterns to predict the class of new, unseen data.

#### This repository contains a collection of machine learning classifiers implemented to solve a variety of problems.
